# Skinchanger Premium CS2 
Skin changer is a painfully familiar skin swap mechanic, though with some new additions. Now you can skin swap CS2 for both a more expensive and a skin cheaper than yours.
Trading CS2 skins now brings real pleasure, because there are no more intermediaries, only you are one-on-one with skins. Feel like
a child in a toy store and take everything that catches your eye


## Functionality Explained

Within the Farmskins environment, the swapping of CS2 skins directly from your personal collection is made straightforward.

The procedure is streamlined: on the left, choose the skins you're putting forward for exchange. Afterward, on the right, choose the specific skin you'd like to acquire, and then finalize the trade.

Should the skin you desire costs more than the cumulative worth of the skins you're providing, you can bridge the gap using Bullets.

Conversely, if the collective worth of your skins exceeds the exchange skin's price, you'll receive the difference back in your Bullets balance.

Bullets effectively function as a universal method of payment, suitable for adjusting the transaction amount in either direction. This adaptability significantly streamlines your CS2 skin transactions, and improves your overall user experience.
